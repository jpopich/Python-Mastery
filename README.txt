# Python Journey

This repository is my personal journey from Python beginner to mastery.  
I will be working through several Python books and completing every exercise,  
project, and practice activity along the way.

Each book will have its own folder, and inside each folder I’ll keep:
- Exercises and solutions
- Notes on what I learned
- Any small projects or scripts I build

The goal of this repo is to stay consistent, practice real coding, and track  
my progress as I improve my Python skills over time.

Nothing fancy — just steady learning, clean code, and growth.
